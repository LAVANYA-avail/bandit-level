Level Goal

At this moment, level 34 does not exist yet.

Explanation:

In Bandit level 33–34, after logging into the Bandit33 account, a message is displayed instead of a challenge. This level does not contain any commands or tasks to perform. 
The message clearly states that there is no Bandit34 level available at this time. This level marks the completion of the Bandit wargame and confirms that all challenges have been successfully finished. 
It serves as an ending message for users who have completed all previous Bandit levels.
