Level Goal
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit28-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

Explanation:

In Bandit level 28–29, first create a new directory using the mkdir command and move into that directory using the cd command. 
After that, use the git clone command followed by the given SSH link to clone the repository. Once the cloning process is completed, use the ls command to list the files and then change into the cloned directory using the cd command.
Inside the directory, use the ls command to see the available files and read them using the cat command. In this level, the password is not available in the latest version of the file, so the Git commit history must be checked. 
By using Git commands to view previous commits, the password for the next level can be found. This level teaches how to inspect Git commit history to recover hidden or removed information.
