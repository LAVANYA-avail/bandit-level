Level Goal


After all this git stuff, it’s time for another escape. Good luck!


Explanation:

In Bandit level 32–33, after logging into the Bandit32 account, a restricted shell is provided where most commands do not work normally. 
In this level, the shell converts all typed commands into uppercase, which prevents standard command execution. To solve this level, the environment variables are used to escape from the restricted shell. 
By executing the shell using the $0 variable, a normal shell is obtained. After gaining access to the normal shell, use standard commands to read the password file and retrieve the password for the next level. 
This level helps in understanding restricted shells and how environment variables can be used to bypass command limitations.
