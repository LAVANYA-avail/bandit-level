Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data

Explanation:
Bandit Level 10 focuses on decoding data that has been encoded using Base64, a common encoding method used to safely transmit data. 
After logging in as bandit10 using the password obtained from the previous level, the user finds a file named data.txt in the home directory. The contents of this file appear unreadable at first because they are encoded rather than encrypted.
To retrieve the password for Bandit Level 11, the user uses the base64 command with the decode option to convert the encoded text back into its original readable form. Once decoded, the output clearly reveals the password for the next level. 
This level teaches how encoding works, how to recognize Base64-encoded data, and how to decode it using Linux command‑line tools, which is an important skill in cybersecurity and data analysis.
