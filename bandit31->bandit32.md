Level Goal

There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit31-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

Explanation:

In Bandit level 31–32, first create a new directory using the mkdir command and move into that directory using the cd command. 
After that, use the git clone command with the given SSH link to clone the repository. Once the repository is cloned, use the ls command to list the files and enter the cloned directory using the cd command. 
Inside the directory, use the ls command to view the files and read the instructions using the cat command. In this level, a file must be modified and pushed back to the remote Git repository.
By following the given instructions, committing the required changes, and pushing them to the repository, the password for the next level is displayed. This level helps in understanding how to modify files, commit changes, and push updates using Git.
