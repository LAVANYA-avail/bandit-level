Level Goal

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

Explanation:

Bandit Level 17 focuses on comparing files to find a difference. After logging in as bandit17, the user finds two files in the home directory named passwords.old and passwords.new. 
Both files look very similar, but only one line is different between them. The task is to identify this difference, which reveals the password for bandit18. By using file comparison techniques, the user can quickly locate the changed line instead of reading the entire files manually. 
This level teaches how to compare files efficiently in Linux, a skill commonly used in system administration, debugging, and security analysis to detect changes or updates in data.
