Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

Explanation:
Bandit Level 11 focuses on decoding a file that has been encoded using the ROT13 cipher, which is a simple letter substitution method that replaces each letter with the one 13 positions down the alphabet. 
After logging in as bandit11 using the password obtained from the previous level, the user finds a file in the home directory containing the encoded password for Bandit Level 12. 
To decode it, the tr command is used to rotate all letters by 13 positions, effectively reversing the ROT13 encoding. Once the transformation is applied, the readable output reveals the password for the next level.
