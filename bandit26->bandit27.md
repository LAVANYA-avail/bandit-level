Level Goal
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27

Explanation:

In Bandit level 26–27, first log in to the Bandit26 account using the SSH private key obtained from the previous level.
After logging in, the system opens in a restricted environment where normal shell access is limited. To solve this level, the more command is used to open a text viewer, and from there the shell can be escaped. 
By setting the terminal size to a small value and reopening the session, the more program allows access to its command mode. From this mode, a normal shell can be executed. 
Once the shell is available, use standard commands to read the password file and obtain the password for the next level. 
This level helps in understanding how restricted environments can be bypassed using terminal behavior and pager commands.
