Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

Explanation:
Bandit Level 3 focuses on understanding hidden files in a Linux system. After logging in as bandit3 using the password obtained from the previous level, the user navigates to the home directory and notices that no obvious password file is visible using the normal ls command.
In Linux, files whose names begin with a dot (.) are hidden by default and are not shown unless specifically requested. By using the ls -a command, which displays all files including hidden ones, the user discovers a hidden file named .hidden. Reading the contents of this file using the cat command reveals the password for Bandit Level 4.
This level teaches how hidden files work in Linux and highlights the importance of using appropriate command options to view all files in a directory.
