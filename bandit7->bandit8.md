Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

Explanation:
Bandit Level 7 introduces the use of text searching commands to locate specific information within a file. After logging in as bandit7 using the password obtained from the previous level, the user finds a directory named inhere containing a file called data.txt. 
The challenge is to find the password for Bandit Level 8, which is located on the same line as the word “millionth” within this file. To solve this, the user employs the grep command to search for the specific word and display the entire line containing it. Executing this command reveals the password for the next level. 
This level teaches how to efficiently search for keywords in files using grep, a fundamental skill for analyzing log files, configuration files, and large datasets in Linux.
